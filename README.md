# push_swap
push_swap project is about sorting list. It is very simple to understand and also look simple. There is a limited amount of possible action to apply on the list to sort it. Those limited possibility make it impossible to use well know and effective algorithm already created. The goal is to create one or many complex sorting algorithm to sort the list with the imposed move you can do.
